Hey, Im Azirm6513.
Thanks for checking out my github profile. I am currently working on full stack projects from classwork and a few personal projects, like my personal website **cjsolutions.tech**.

Im fine with working with the correct language for the project but im most comfortable with:
1. JavaScript / TypeScript (React, Node, Express)
2. Java (Spring Boot)
3. MongoDB
4. PostgreSQL

Please feel free to contact me with any offers for work or collaborative projects **christianjortiz7@gmail.com**.
